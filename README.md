# Hacker News - Hide Visited Comments

Just a simple content script for Chrome that hides Hacker News comment threads
once you visit their tab. If logged in, it will also hide it on all accounts
you've signed into Hacker News with (using Hacker News' built-in "hide"
function, so will even work on mobile).

Currently there are no customizations - to turn off, just disable the
extension.
